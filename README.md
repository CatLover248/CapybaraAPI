# CapybaraAPI
> An API coded in Python with Flask that gives functions related to getting images of capybaras!

> I am open to pull requests - Please reach out to me if you are interested in contributing.

# TODO List
> Adding more functionallity
  - /get_amount/:val - gets a numbered amount of capybara images.
  - Adding more queries to the list of urls.
  - A discord server maybe?

# Why did I not use a database?
> Why?
  - Because I felt that it would cause issues relating to complexity. Currently, adding more capybara images is easy - just add a image url. But that process may be overcompilcated if a database would have been added.
> Will this be added in the future?
  - I am considering plans of adding a database such as mysql or postgresql or etc if the amount of entries increase to very height amount.

# How to host?
- 1. Make sure you have these python libraries installed:
  - random
  - Flask

- 2. Simply run the application using the command bellow:

> flask --app main.py run -p 80

- You can also change the port number to something else by changing out 80 for something else.
